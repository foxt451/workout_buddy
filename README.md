# workout_buddy
Django app using, among other things:
* django allauth app, with email confirmation and Google OAuth (since this app uses simple gmail smtp to send emails, which is not bulletproof, authentication may at some point stop working)
* geodjango
* ip-based geolocation
* google maps integration
